## What is Purplship?

Purplship is a multi-carrier service integration platform. The idea is to simplify the process of integrating your logistics carrier services into your application using a modern and simplified API. Most of the major carriers make their services available using web services. \
However, the developer's experience with those web services is far from convenient because most of them are still using arcane technologies such as SOAP with XML data format and notably very long and complex documentations. Added to that, the long and painful process has to be done over and over again for each carrier your desire to integrate with.

Purplship aims to lower the barrier of entry for carriers web service integration by proposing a unified interface to communicate with all carriers, thus a modern API with a lean documentation.
